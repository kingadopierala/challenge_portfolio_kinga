# Taski 1: Software configuration
*Podzadanie 1: Why did I decide to take part in the Dare IT Challenge?*

I have been a manual tester for over a year. At work, I test mobile applications on iOS and Android devices. I would like to develop further in my profession, so I decided to join the DareIT challenge. I really like the 7-week formula, during which I will prepare my portfolio and gain basic knowledge in the field of automated tests, which will allow me to develop in a new direction.
